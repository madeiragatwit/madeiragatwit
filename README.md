I'm currently a senior at Wentworth Institute of Technology studying with a major in Computer Science and a minor in Applied Mathematics. I enjoy working with others to create cool projects and seeing our hard work come together.

I'm always interested in learning something new even though I may not have had experience with it before. I also enjoy learning all the different aspects of Computer Science and what tasks different jobs within the industry involve.

The aspects of Computer Science I enjoy the most involve creating UI/UX and developing software to make a task easier to do! Solving problems and puzzles with code always leads to a satisfying result.
